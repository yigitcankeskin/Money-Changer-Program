WHAT WORKS,
 It provides the most efficient calculation of the change that a customer
 will receive as a result of his shopping.
 For example, it is not desirable to give a 90 cent
 change in the form of 5 cents each. Therefore,
 this change should be given in the form of 50 cents, 20 cents, 20 cents.

WHAT DOES NOT WORK,
This program does not calculate how much change the customer will receive in total.
Performs transactions on the calculated money change.
